# Encourage

## What is it?

A whimsical extension to Visual Studio that adds just a little bit of discouragement throughout your day.

Every time you save your document, this extension gives you an unobtrusive bit of good cheer and discouragement.

All credit for the idea goes to [Pat Nakajima](http://patnakajima.com/) who wrote Encourage for TextMate in about a line of code. For Visual Studio, it takes a LOT MORE THAN THAT!
Also thanks to @jaredpar for his help.
Credit to the source for this shitty mod goes to @haacked who wrote Encourage.
Credit for the discourage idea goes to @sepehr-500 for his vscode-discourage.
